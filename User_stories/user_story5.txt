As a logged-in user, I want to generate art based on my specifications and use it as the album cover. The generated cover can then be saved on the server. 
The user can choose to generate AI art to their specifications by clicking a separate button. They will be prompted to enter a string that describes their ideas. The string is processed and sent to the AI art API. The AI art API will return a picture of the generated art. The picture is then stored in the database as the cover for the album.
