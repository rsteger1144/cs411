As a user, I can log in to the app using Spotify authentication. I want to log in using my Spotify account and password. I will be able to save my previous album/song cover creations after logging in.
The user will begin by authorizing the app permission to access their Spotify account and their playlist. In the case they do not have a Spotify account, they will be directed to the Spotify registration page where they can sign up for a Spotify account. Once the account is linked, the app will have access to the playlists made by the user, as well as the songs within the playlists. The app will send any playlist covers generated by the user into a database which the user will have access to retrieve again if they decide to do so.
