As a logged-in user, if I do not want to use the NASAs space photo, I can also use an AI to generate art based on the songâ€™s features. So, they can be used as album covers and saved on the server.
The user can choose between the NASA photo and the AI art by clicking different buttons. Once they click the button, the application will load the scripts and metadata through Spotify API. These data will be processed and sent to the AI art API. The AI art API will return a picture of the generated art. The picture is then stored in the database as the cover for the album.
