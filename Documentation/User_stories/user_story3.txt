As a logged-in user, I want to find the NASA photo taken on the day of the album release and set it as the album's new cover. I want to change the cover albums/song image to a space image since I love space. As a space and science lover, changing my favorite album/song cover to the space photos of the day would be amazing.
The user can choose the NASA photo by clicking the button. Once the user clicks the button, the application will automatically retrieve the album's metadata and get the album's release date. The application will then try to retrieve a photo from the NASA photo API. The NASA API will return a photo taken on that date. The application will then use that photo as the album cover. If there is no photo returned. The application will check the closest date that has a NASA photo corresponding to it. The photo returned will be stored in the database as the cover of the song.
